## Premise
Mandelbrot rust is a program I've created to learn the basics of rust. It has a simple premise: to provide an API that can be queried to determine if a number is part of the Mandelbrot set. It's designed to be used to render the Mandelbrot set, which is why it contains functions for mapping a screen to the complex plane.
